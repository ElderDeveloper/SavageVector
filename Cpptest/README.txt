Welcome to the Savage Game Studios C++ programming test!

In this package you will find the following files:

    cpptest.h
        A header that contains the interface you should implement.

    cpptest.cpp
        A small test harness to get you started quickly. We have a further full
        test harness that we will run your code with.

    cpptest.sln
    cpptest.vcxproj
    cpptest.vcxproj.filters
        Visual Studio 2019 files to build and run the project.

    Makefile
        A makefile to build and run the project if you are working on a Mac or
        Linux system.

Your task is to implement the interface specified in cpptest.h, and to make
sure the project compiles and the resulting executable completes without
errors.

Pay special attention to correctness and expect that your code will be reviewed
considering use cases beyond the simple test harness that is provided.

When submitting, please supply cpptest.h, and cpptest.cpp if you have made
modifications to it, for example extending the test harness. The full
implementation should be contained within cpptest.h.
